# FaceMaskDetection
* Our team worked on creating a device for face mask detection and temperature sensing using the **ESP8266** module. The module is connected with **Temp. sensor (MLX90614)** and **servo motor (TowerPro SG90)** for gate-gear mechanism as a response. The device was first simulated on **Proteus 8** software. 
* Presently, we are using **Blynk** to output responses, and we are trying to develop this device for a wider use. 
* Used **MediaPipe** library to create a model for face detection. Used **MobileNet V2** to check if the subject was wearing a mask or not. Our team used **Transfer Learning** to custom-tune the model for this purpose.
